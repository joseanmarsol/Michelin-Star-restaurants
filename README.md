Data analysis on Michelin Star restaurants

The Michelin Guides are a series of guide books that have been published by the French tyre company Michelin since 1904. The Guide awards up to three Michelin stars for excellence to a select few establishments. The acquisition or loss of a star can have dramatic effects on the success of a restaurant.

With this project I intend to answer the following questions:

- How are the restaurants awarded with michelin stars (1, 2 or 3) distributed along the world?
- What types of cuisines do they practice?
